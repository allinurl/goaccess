What is it?
-------------
GoAccess is a FLOSS real-time web log analyzer and interactive viewer
that runs in a terminal in *nix systems or through your browser.

It provides fast and valuable HTTP statistics for system administrators that
require a visual server report on the fly.

Features
-------------------------------
GoAccess parses the specified web log file and
outputs the data to the X terminal. Features include:

  * Completely Real Time
    All panels and metrics are timed to be updated every 200 ms on the terminal
    output and every second on the HTML output.

  * No configuration needed
    You can just run it against your access log file, pick the log format and
    let GoAccess parse the access log and show you the stats.

  * Track Application Response Time
    Track the time taken to serve the request. Extremely useful if you want to
    track pages that are slowing down your site.

  * Nearly All Web Log Formats
    GoAccess allows any custom log format string. Predefined options include,
    Apache, Nginx, Amazon S3, Elastic Load Balancing, CloudFront, etc

  * Incremental Log Processing
    Need data persistence? GoAccess has the ability to process logs incrementally
    through the on-disk B+Tree database.

  * Only one dependency
    GoAccess is written in C. To run it, you only need ncurses as a dependency.
    That's it. It even has its own Web Socket server -  http://gwsocket.io/.

  * Visitors
    Determine the amount of hits, visitors, bandwidth, and metrics for slowest
    running requests by the hour, or date.

  *  Metrics per Virtual Host
    Have multiple Virtual Hosts (Server Blocks)? A panel that displays which
    virtual host is consuming most of the web server resources.

  * Color Scheme Customizable
    Tailor GoAccess to suit your own color taste/schemes. Either through the
    terminal, or by simply updating the stylesheet on the HTML output.

  * Support for large datasets
    GoAccess features the ability to parse large logs due to its optimized
    in-memory hash tables. It has very good memory usage and pretty good
    performance. This storage has support for on-disk persistence as well.

  * Docker support
    GoAccess comes with a default Docker (https://hub.docker.com/r/allinurl/goaccess/)
    that will listen for HTTP connections on port 7890. Although, you can still
    fully configure it, by using Volume mapping and editing goaccess.conf.

Why GoAccess?
-------------
GoAccess was designed to be a fast, terminal-based log analyzer. Its core idea
is to quickly analyze and view web server statistics in real time without
needing to use your browser (great if you want to do a quick analysis of your
access log via SSH, or if you simply love working in the terminal).

While the terminal output is the default output, it has the capability to
generate a complete real-time HTML report, as well as a JSON, and CSV report.

You can see it more of a monitor command tool than anything else.

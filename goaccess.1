.SH NAME
goaccess \- fast web log analyzer and interactive viewer.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B goaccess [-f
.I input-file
.B ]
.I [-c] [-r][-d][-m][-q][-o][-h][...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B goaccess
is a free (GPL) real-time web log analyzer and interactive 
viewer that runs in a terminal in *nix systems. 
It provides fast and valuable HTTP statistics for system 
administrators that require a visual server report on the fly.
First it will parse the web log file, then it will collect data 
from the parsed file and it will display it 
to the console or the X terminal. The collected information will be 
displayed to the user in a visual/interactive window. 
The collected information includes:

.IP "General Statistics:"
Total number of valid requests,
Total number of invalid requests,
Total time to analyze the data,
Total unique visitors, 
Total unique requested files,
Total unique static files 
.IR (css, ico, jpg, js, swf, gif, png)
Total unique HTTP referrers (URLs),
Total unique 404s 
.I (not found),
Size of the parsed log file,
Total bandwidth consumption.
.IP "Unique visitors:"
HTTP requests having the same IP, 
same date and same agent will be 
considered a unique visit. 
.I (including crawlers).
.IP "Requested files"
Hit totals are based on total requests.
This module will display hits, percent, [bandwidth, time served]
.IP "Requested static files"
Hit totals are based on total requests. Includes files such as:
jpg, css, swf, js, gif, png etc. This module will display hits,
percent, [bandwidth, time served]
.IP "404 or Not Found"
Hit totals are based on total requests. This module will display
hits, percent, [bandwidth, time served]
.IP "Hosts"
Hit totals are based on total requests. This module will display
hits, percent, [bandwidth, time served]. The expanded module
can display extra information such as reverse DNS and country.
If -a is enabled, a list of user agents will be displayed.
.IP "Operating Systems"
Hit totals are based on unique visitors. This module will
display hits and percent. The expanded module shows all available
versions of the parent node.
.IP "Browsers"
Hit totals are based on unique visitors. This module will
display hits and percent. The expanded module shows all
available versions of the parent node.
.IP "Referrers URLs"
The URL where the request came from. Hit totals are based on
total requests. This module will display hits and percent.
.IP "Referring Sites"
This module will display only the host but not the whole URL.
The URL where the request came from. Hit totals are based on
total requests. This module will display hits and percent.
.IP "Keyphrases"
This module will report keyphrases used on Google search,
Google cache, and Google translate. Hit totals are based on
total requests. This module will display hits and percent.
.IP "Geo Location"
Determines where an IP address is geographically located. It
outputs the continent and country. If it's unable to determine
the country, location will be marked as unknown.
.IP "HTTP Status Codes"
The values of the numeric status code to HTTP requests.
Hit totals are based on total requests. This module will
display hits and percent.

.SH CUSTOM LOG/DATE FORMAT
GoAccess can parse virtually any web log format. 

Predefined options include, Common Log Format (CLF), 
Combined Log Format (XLF/ELF), including virtual host,
Amazon CloudFront (Download Distribution) and 
W3C format (IIS). 

GoAccess allows any custom format string as well. 

There are two ways to configure the log format.
The easiest is to run GoAccess with
.I -c
to prompt a configuration window. Otherwise, it can be
configured under ~/.goaccessrc.
.IP "date_format"
The 
.I date_format 
variable followed by a space, specifies the log format
date containing any combination of regular characters
and special format specifiers. They all begin with a 
percentage (%) sign. See http://linux.die.net/man/3/strftime
.IP "log_format"
The 
.I log_format 
variable followed by a space, specifies the log format string.
.IP %d
date field matching the
.I date_format
variable.
.IP %h
host (the client IP address, either IPv4 or IPv6)
.IP %r
The request line from the client.
.IP %s
The status code that the server sends back to the client.
.IP %b
The size of the object returned to the client.
.IP %R
The "Referer" HTTP request header.
.IP %u
The User-Agent HTTP request header.
.IP %D
The time taken to serve the request, in microseconds.
.IP %T
The time taken to serve the request, in seconds or milliseconds.
.I Note:
%D will take priority over %T if both are used.
.IP %^
Ignore this field.

.SH EXAMPLES
The simplest and fastest usage would be:

# goaccess -f access.log

That will generate an interactive text-only output.

To generate full statistics we can run GoAccess as:

# goaccess -f access.log -a

To generate an HTML report:

# goaccess -f access.log -a > report.html

To generate a JSON file:

# goaccess -f access.log -a -d -o json > report.json

To generate a CSV file:

# goaccess -f access.log -o csv > report.csv

The 
.I -a 
flag indicates that we want to process an agent-list for every host parsed.

The 
.I -d 
flag indicates that we want to enable the IP resolver on the HTML | JSON output.
(It will take longer time to output since it has to resolve all queries.)

The 
.I -c 
flag will prompt the date and log format configuration window. Only when
curses is initialized.

Now if we want to add more flexibility to GoAccess, we can do a series of  pipes.
For instance:

If we would like to process all
.I access.log.*.gz
we can do:

#  zcat access.log.*.gz | goaccess

OR

#  zcat -f access.log* | goaccess

Another useful pipe would be filtering dates out of the web log

The following will get all HTTP requests starting on 05/Dec/2010 until 
the end of the file.

# sed -n '/05\\/Dec\\/2010/,$ p' access.log | goaccess -a

If we want to parse only a certain time-frame from DATE a to DATE b, we can do:

sed -n '/5\\/Nov\\/2010/,/5\\/Dec\\/2010/ p' access.log | goaccess -a

.I Note that this could take longer time to parse depending on the speed of sed.

.B Also,
it is worth pointing out that if we want to run GoAccess at lower priority, we
can run it as:

# nice -n 19 goaccess -f access.log -a

and if you don't want to install it on your server, you can still run it 
from your local machine:

# ssh root@server 'cat /var/log/apache2/access.log' | goaccess -a

.SH NOTES
For now, each active window has a total of 300 items.
Eventually this will be customizable.

Piping a log to GoAccess will disable the real-time functionality.
This is due to the portability issue on determining the actual size of STDIN.
However, a future release *might* include this feature.

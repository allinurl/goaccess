.SH NAME
goaccess \- fast web log analyzer and interactive viewer.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.B goaccess [filename] [options...] [-c][-M][-H][-q][-d][...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B goaccess
GoAccess is an open source real-time web log analyzer and interactive viewer
that runs in a
.I terminal
in *nix systems or through your
.I browser.
.P
It provides fast and valuable HTTP statistics for system administrators that
require a visual server report on the fly.
.P
GoAccess parses the specified web log file and outputs the data to the X
terminal. Features include:

.IP "General Statistics:"
This panel gives a summary of several metrics, such as the number of valid and
invalid requests, time taken to analyze the dataset, unique visitors, requested
files, static files (CSS, ICO, JPG, etc) HTTP referrers, 404s, size of the
parsed log file and bandwidth consumption.
.IP "Unique visitors"
This panel shows metrics such as hits, unique visitors and cumulative bandwidth
per date. HTTP requests containing the same IP, the same date, and the same
user agent are considered a unique visitor. By default, it includes web
crawlers/spiders.
.IP
Optionally, date specificity can be set to the hour level using
.I --date-spec=hr
which will display dates such as 05/Jun/2016:16. This is great if you want to
track your daily traffic at the hour level.
.IP "Requested files"
This panel displays the most requested (non-static) files on your web server.
It shows hits, unique visitors, and percentage, along with the cumulative
bandwidth, protocol, and the request method used.
.IP "Requested static files"
Lists the most frequently static files such as: JPG, CSS, SWF, JS, GIF, and PNG
file types, along with the same metrics as the last panel. Additional static
files can be added to the configuration file.
.IP "404 or Not Found"
Displays the same metrics as the previous request panels, however, its data
contains all pages that were not found on the server, or commonly known as 404
status code.
.IP "Hosts"
This panel has detailed information on the hosts themselves. This is great for
spotting aggressive crawlers and identifying who's eating your bandwidth.

Expanding the panel can display more information such as host's reverse DNS
lookup result, country of origin and city. If the
.I -a
argument is enabled, a list of user agents can be displayed by selecting the
desired IP address, and then pressing ENTER.
.IP "Operating Systems"
This panel will report which operating system the host used when it hit the
server. It attempts to provide the most specific version of each operating
system.
.IP "Browsers"
This panel will report which browser the host used when it hit the server. It
attempts to provide the most specific version of each browser.
.IP "Visit Times"
This panel will display an hourly report. This option displays 24 data points,
one for each hour of the day.
.IP
Optionally, hour specificity can be set to the tenth of an hour level using
.I --hour-spec=min
which will display hours as 16:4 This is great if you want to spot peaks of
traffic on your server.
.IP "Virtual Hosts"
This panel will display all the different virtual hosts parsed from the access
log. This panel is displayed if
.I %v
is used within the log-format string.
.IP "Referrers URLs"
If the host in question accessed the site via another resource, or was
linked/diverted to you from another host, the URL they were referred from will
be provided in this panel. See `--ignore-panel` in your configuration file to
enable it.
.I disabled
by default.
.IP "Referring Sites"
This panel will display only the host part but not the whole URL. The URL where
the request came from.
.IP "Keyphrases"
It reports keyphrases used on Google search, Google cache, and Google translate
that have lead to your web server. At present, it only supports Google search
queries via HTTP. See `--ignore-panel` in your configuration file to enable it.
.I disabled
by default.
.IP "Geo Location"
Determines where an IP address is geographically located. Statistics are broken
down by continent and country. It needs to be compiled with GeoLocation
support.
.IP "HTTP Status Codes"
The values of the numeric status code to HTTP requests.
.IP "Remote User (HTTP authentication)"
This is the userid of the person requesting the document as determined by HTTP
authentication. If the document is not password protected, this part will be
"-" just like the previous one. This panel is not enabled unless
.I %e
is given within the log-format variable.
.IP "Cache Status"
If you are using caching on your server, you may be at the point where you
want to know if your request is being cached and served from the cache.  This
panel shows the cache status of the object the server served. This panel is not
enabled unless
.I %C
is given within the log-format variable. The status can be either
 `MISS`, `BYPASS`, `EXPIRED`, `STALE`, `UPDATING`, `REVALIDATED` or `HIT`

.P
.I NOTE:
Optionally and if configured, all panels can display the average time taken to
serve the request.

.SH STORAGE
.P
There are three storage options that can be used with GoAccess. Choosing one
will depend on your environment and needs.
.TP
Default Hash Tables
In-memory storage provides better performance at the cost of limiting the
dataset size to the amount of available physical memory. By default GoAccess
uses in-memory hash tables. If your dataset can fit in memory, then this will
perform fine. It has very good memory usage and pretty good performance.
.TP
Tokyo Cabinet On-Disk B+ Tree
Use this storage method for large datasets where it is not possible to fit
everything in memory. The B+ tree database is slower than any of the hash
databases since data has to be committed to disk. However, using an SSD greatly
increases the performance. You may also use this storage method if you need
data persistence to quickly load statistics at a later date.
.TP
Tokyo Cabinet In-memory Hash Database
An alternative to the default hash tables. It uses generic typing and thus it's
performance in terms of memory and speed is average.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.P
Multiple options can be used to configure GoAccess. For a complete up-to-date
list of configure options, run
.I ./configure --help
.TP
\fB\-\-enable-debug
Compile with debugging symbols and turn off compiler optimizations.
.TP
\fB\-\-enable-utf8
Compile with wide character support. Ncursesw is required.
.TP
\fB\-\-enable-geoip=<legacy|mmdb>
Compile with GeoLocation support. MaxMind's GeoIP is required.
.I legacy
will utilize the original GeoIP databases.
.I mmdb
will utilize the enhanced GeoIP2 databases.
.TP
\fB\-\-enable-tcb=<memhash|btree>
Compile with Tokyo Cabinet storage support.
.I memhash
will utilize Tokyo Cabinet's on-memory hash database.
.I btree
will utilize Tokyo Cabinet's on-disk B+ Tree database.
.TP
\fB\-\-disable-zlib
Disable zlib compression on B+ Tree database.
.TP
\fB\-\-disable-bzip
Disable bzip2 compression on B+ Tree database.
.TP
\fB\-\-with-getline

using a fixed size buffer of 4096.
.TP
\fB\-\-with-openssl
Compile GoAccess with OpenSSL support for its WebSocket server.
.SH OPTIONS
.P
The following options can be supplied to the command or specified in the
configuration file. If specified in the configuration file, long options need
to be used without prepending -- and without using the equal sign =.
.SS
LOG/DATE/TIME FORMAT
.TP
\fB\-\-time-format=<timeformat>
The time-format variable followed by a space, specifies the log format time
containing either a name of a predefined format (see options below) or any
combination of regular characters and special format specifiers.
.IP
They all begin with a percentage (%) sign. See `man strftime`.

%f
must be used as date-format
.TP
\fB\-\-log-format=<logformat>
The log-format variable followed by a space or
.I \\\\t
for tab-delimited, specifies the log format string.

Note that if there are spaces within the format, the string needs to be
enclosed in single/double quotes. Inner quotes need to be escaped.
.IP
In addition to specifying the raw log/date/time formats, for simplicity, any of
the following predefined log format names can be supplied to the
log/date/time-format variables. GoAccess can also handle one predefined name in
one variable and another predefined name in another variable.

.IP
Note: It's important to make use of absolute paths across GoAccess'
configuration.
.TP
\fB\-\-user-name=<username>
Run GoAccess as the specified user.
.IP
Note: It's important to ensure the user or the users' group can access the
input and output files as well as any other files needed.
Other groups the user belongs to will be ignored.
As such it's advised to run GoAccess behind a SSL proxy as it's unlikely this
user can access the SSL certificates.
.TP
\fB\-\-origin=<url>
Ensure clients send the specified origin header upon the WebSocket handshake.
.TP
\fB\-\-pid-file=<path/goaccess.pid>

GoAccess uses its own WebSocket server to push the data from the server to the
client. See http://gwsocket.io for more details how the WebSocket server works.
.TP
\fB\-\-ws-url=<[scheme://]url[:port]>
URL to which the WebSocket server responds. This is the URL supplied to the
WebSocket constructor on the client side.

for unencrypted and encrypted connections. e.g.,
.I
wss://goaccess.io
.IP
If GoAccess is running behind a proxy, you could set the client side to connect
to a different port by specifying the host followed by a colon and the port.
e.g.,
.I goaccess.io:9999
.IP
By default, it will attempt to connect to the generated report's hostname. If
GoAccess is running on a remote server, the host of the remote server should be
specified here. Also, make sure it is a valid host and NOT an http address.
.TP
\fB\-\-fifo-in=<path/file>

Specifies the number of elements of the bucket array. If it is not more than 0,
the default value is specified. The default value is 32749. Suggested size of
the bucket array is about from 1 to 4 times of the number of all pages to be
stored.

Only if configured with --enable-tcb=btree
.TP
\fB\-\-compression=<zlib|bz2>
Specifies that each page is compressed with ZLIB|BZ2 encoding.

Only if configured with --enable-tcb=btree

.SH CUSTOM LOG/DATE FORMAT
GoAccess can parse virtually any web log format.
.P
Predefined options include, Common Log Format (CLF), Combined Log Format
(XLF/ELF), including virtual host, Amazon CloudFront (Download Distribution),
Google Cloud Storage and W3C format (IIS).
.P
GoAccess allows any custom format string as well.
.P
There are two ways to configure the log format.
The easiest is to run GoAccess with
.I -c
to prompt a configuration window. Otherwise, it can be configured under
~/.goaccessrc or the %sysconfdir%.
.IP "time-format"
The
.I time-format
variable followed by a space, specifies the log format time
containing any combination of regular characters and special format specifiers.
They all begin with a percentage (%) sign. See `man strftime`.
.I %T or %H:%M:%S.
.IP
.I Note:
If a timestamp is given in microseconds,
.I
%f
must be used as
.I
time-format
.IP "date-format"
The
.I date-format
variable followed by a space, specifies the log format date containing any
combination of regular characters and special format specifiers. They all begin
with a percentage (%) sign. See `man strftime`. e.g.,
.I %Y-%m-%d.
.IP
.I Note:
If a timestamp is given in microseconds,
.I
%f
must be used as
.I
date-format
.IP "log-format"
The
.I log-format
variable followed by a space or
.I \\\\t
, specifies the log format string.
.IP %x
A date and time field matching the
.I time-format
and
.I date-format
variables. This is used when given a timestamp or the date & time are
concatenated as a single string (e.g., 1501647332 or 20170801235000) instead of
the date and time being in two separated variables.
.IP %t
time field matching the
.I time-format
variable.
.IP %d
date field matching the
.I date-format
variable.
.IP %v
The canonical Server Name of the server serving the request (Virtual Host).
.IP %e
This is the userid of the person requesting the document as determined by HTTP
authentication.
.IP %C
The cache status of the object the server served.
.IP %h
host (the client IP address, either IPv4 or IPv6)
.IP %r
The request line from the client. This requires specific delimiters around the
request (as single quotes, double quotes, or anything else) to be parsable. If
not, we have to use a combination of special format specifiers as %m %U %H.
.IP %q
The query string.
.IP %m
The request method.
.IP %U
The URL path requested.

.I Note:
If the query string is in %U, there is no need to use
.I %q.
However, if the URL path, does not include any query string, you may use
.I %q
and the query string will be appended to the request.
.IP %H
The request protocol.
.IP %s
The status code that the server sends back to the client.
.IP %b
The size of the object returned to the client.
.IP %R
The "Referrer" HTTP request header.
.IP %u
The user-agent HTTP request header.
.IP %K
The TLS encryption settings chosen for the connection. (In Apache LogFormat: %{SSL_PROTOCOL}x %{SSL_CIPHER}x)
.IP %M
The MIME-type of the requested resource. (In Apache LogFormat: %{Content-Type}o)
.IP %D
The time taken to serve the request, in microseconds as a decimal number.
.IP %T
The time taken to serve the request, in seconds with milliseconds resolution.
.IP %L
The time taken to serve the request, in milliseconds as a decimal number.
.IP %^
Ignore this field.
.IP %~
Move forward through the log string until a non-space (!isspace) char is found.
.IP ~h
The host (the client IP address, either IPv4 or IPv6) in a X-Forwarded-For (XFF) field.

It uses a special specifier which consists of a tilde before the host
specifier, followed by the character(s) that delimit the XFF field, which are
enclosed by curly braces (i.e., ~h{," })

For example, ~h{," } is used in order to parse "11.25.11.53, 17.68.33.17" field
which is delimited by a double quote, a comma, and a space.
.P
.I Note:
In order to get the average, cumulative and maximum time served in GoAccess,
you will need to start logging response times in your web server. In Nginx you
can add
.I $request_time
to your log format, or
.I %D
in Apache.
.P
.I Important:
If multiple time served specifiers are used at the same time, the first option
specified in the format string will take priority over the other specifiers.
.P
GoAccess
.I requires
the following fields:
.IP
.I %h
a valid IPv4/6
.IP
.I %d
a valid date
.IP
.I %r
the request

.SH EXAMPLES
.I Note:
Piping data into GoAccess won't prompt a log/date/time configuration dialog,
you will need to previously define it in your configuration file or in the
command line.

.SS
DIFFERENT OUTPUTS
.P
To output to a terminal and generate an interactive report:
.IP
# goaccess access.log
.P
To generate an HTML report:
.IP
# goaccess access.log -a -o report.html
.P
To generate a JSON report:
.IP
# goaccess access.log -a -d -o report.json
.P
To generate a CSV file:
.IP
# goaccess access.log --no-csv-summary -o report.csv
.P
GoAccess also allows great flexibility for real-time filtering and parsing. For
instance, to quickly diagnose issues by monitoring logs since goaccess was
started:
.IP
# tail -f access.log | goaccess -
.P
And even better, to filter while maintaining opened a pipe to preserve
real-time analysis, we can make use of
.I tail -f
and
a matching pattern tool such as
.I grep, awk, sed,
etc:
.IP
# tail -f access.log | grep -i --line-buffered 'firefox' | goaccess --log-format=COMBINED -
.P
or to parse from the beginning of the file while maintaining the pipe opened
and applying a filter
.IP
# tail -f -n +0 access.log | grep -i --line-buffered 'firefox' | goaccess --log-format=COMBINED -o report.html --real-time-html -
.SS
MULTIPLE LOG FILES
.P
There are several ways to parse multiple logs with GoAccess. The simplest is to
pass multiple log files to the command line:
.IP
# goaccess access.log access.log.1
.P
It's even possible to parse files from a pipe while reading regular files:
.IP
# cat access.log.2 | goaccess access.log access.log.1 -
.P
.I Note
that the single dash is appended to the command line to let GoAccess know that
it should read from the pipe.
.P
Now if we want to add more flexibility to GoAccess, we can do a series of
pipes. For instance, if we would like to process all compressed log files
.I access.log.*.gz
in addition to the current log file, we can do:
.IP
# zcat access.log.*.gz | goaccess access.log -
.P
.I Note:
On Mac OS X, use gunzip -c instead of zcat.
.SS
REAL TIME HTML OUTPUT
.P
GoAccess has the ability to output real-time data in the HTML report. You can
even email the HTML file since it is composed of a single file with no external
file dependencies, how neat is that!
.P
The process of generating a real-time HTML report is very similar to the
process of creating a static report. Only --real-time-html is needed to make it
real-time.
.IP
# goaccess access.log -o /usr/share/nginx/html/site/report.html --real-time-html
.P
By default, GoAccess will use the host name of the generated report.
Optionally, you can specify the URL to which the client's browser will connect
to. See https://goaccess.io/faq for a more detailed example.
.IP
# goaccess access.log -o report.html --real-time-html --ws-url=goaccess.io
.P
By default, GoAccess listens on port 7890, to use a different port other than
7890, you can specify it as (make sure the port is opened):
.IP
# goaccess access.log -o report.html --real-time-html --port=9870
.P
And to bind the WebSocket server to a different address other than 0.0.0.0, you
can specify it as:
.IP
# goaccess access.log -o report.html --real-time-html --addr=127.0.0.1
.P
.I Note:
To output real time data over a TLS/SSL connection, you need to use
.I --ssl-cert=<cert.crt>
and
.I --ssl-key=<priv.key>.
.SS
WORKING WITH DATES
.P
Another useful pipe would be filtering dates out of the web log
.P
The following will get all HTTP requests starting on 05/Dec/2010 until the end
of the file.
.IP
# sed -n '/05\/Dec\/2010/,$ p' access.log | goaccess -a -
.P
or using relative dates such as yesterdays or tomorrows day:
.IP
# sed -n '/'$(date '+%d\/%b\/%Y' -d '1 week ago')'/,$ p' access.log | goaccess -a -
.P
If we want to parse only a certain time-frame from DATE a to DATE b, we can do:
.IP
# sed -n '/5\/Nov\/2010/,/5\/Dec\/2010/ p' access.log | goaccess -a -
.SS
VIRTUAL HOSTS
.P
Assuming your log contains the virtual host (server blocks) field. For
instance:
.IP
vhost.com:80 10.131.40.139 - - [02/Mar/2016:08:14:04 -0600] "GET /shop/bag-p-20
HTTP/1.1" 200 6715 "-" "Apache (internal dummy connection)"
.P
And you would like to append the virtual host to the request in order to see
which virtual host the top urls belong to
.IP
awk '$8=$1$8' access.log | goaccess -a -
.P
To exclude a list of virtual hosts you can do the following:
.IP
# grep -v "`cat exclude_vhost_list_file`" vhost_access.log | goaccess -
.SS
FILES & STATUS CODES
.P
To parse specific pages, e.g., page views, html, htm, php, etc. within a
request:
.IP
# awk '$7~/\.html|\.htm|\.php/' access.log | goaccess -
.P
Note,
.I $7
is the request field for the common and combined log format, (without Virtual
Host), if your log includes Virtual Host, then you probably want to use
.I $8
instead. It's best to check which field you are shooting for, e.g.:
.IP
# tail -10 access.log | awk '{print $8}'
.P
Or to parse a specific status code, e.g., 500 (Internal Server Error):
.IP
# awk '$9~/500/' access.log | goaccess -
.SS
SERVER
.P
Also, it is worth pointing out that if we want to run GoAccess at lower
priority, we can run it as:
.IP
# nice -n 19 goaccess -f access.log -a
.P
and if you don't want to install it on your server, you can still run it from
your local machine:
.IP
# ssh root@server 'cat /var/log/apache2/access.log' | goaccess -a -
.SS
INCREMENTAL LOG PROCESSING
.P
GoAccess has the ability to process logs incrementally through the on-disk
B+Tree database. It works in the following way:

.nr step 1 1
.IP \n[step] 3
A dataset must be persisted first with
.I --keep-db-files,
then the same dataset can be loaded with
.I --load-from-disk.
.IP \n+[step]
If new data is passed (piped or through a log file), it will append it to the
original dataset.
.IP \n+[step]
To preserve the data at all times,
.I --keep-db-files
must be used.
.IP \n+[step]
If
.I --load-from-disk
is used without
.I --keep-db-files,
database files will be deleted upon closing the program.
.P
For instance:
.IP
// last month access log
.br
goaccess access.log.1 --keep-db-files
.P
then, load it with
.IP
// append this month access log, and preserve new data
.br
goaccess access.log --load-from-disk --keep-db-files
.P
To read persisted data only (without parsing new data)
.IP
goaccess --load-from-disk --keep-db-files
.P
.SH NOTES
Each active panel has a total of 366 items or 50 in the real-time HTML report.
The number of items is customizable using
.I max-items
However, only the CSV and JSON output allow a maximum number greater than the
default value of 366 items per panel.
.P
When analyzing the same log file twice using the on-disk B+Tree and using
.I --keep-db-files
and
.I --load-from-disk
on each run, GoAccess will count each entry twice. Issue #334 will address this
issue.
.P
A hit is a request (line in the access log), e.g., 10 requests = 10 hits. HTTP
requests with the same IP, date, and user agent are considered a unique visit.

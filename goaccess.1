.SH NAME
goaccess \- fast web log analyzer and interactive viewer.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.B goaccess [-f input-file][\-c][\-r][\-d][\-m][\-q][\-o][\-h][...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B goaccess
is a free (GPL) real-time web log analyzer and interactive viewer that runs in a
terminal in *nix systems. It provides fast and valuable HTTP statistics for
system administrators that require a visual server report on the fly. GoAccess
parses the specified web log file and outputs the data to the X terminal.
Features include:

.IP "General Statistics:"
Number of valid requests, number of invalid requests, time to analyze the data,
unique visitors, unique requested files, unique static files (css, ico, jpg, js,
swf, gif, png) unique HTTP referrers (URLs), unique 404s (not found), size of
the parsed log file, bandwidth consumption.
.IP "Unique visitors:"
HTTP requests having the same IP, same date and same agent will be considered a
unique visit. This includes crawlers.
.IP "Requested files"
Hit totals are based on total requests. This module will display hits, percent,
bandwidth [time served], [protocol] and [method].
.IP "Requested static files"
Hit totals are based on total requests. Includes files such as: jpg, css, swf,
js, gif, png etc. This module will display hits, percent, bandwidth, [time
served], [protocol] and [method].
.IP "404 or Not Found"
Hit totals are based on total requests. This module will display hits, percent,
bandwidth, [time served], [protocol] and [method].
.IP "Hosts"
Hit totals are based on total requests. This module will display hits, percent,
[bandwidth, time served]. The expanded module can display extra information such
as reverse DNS and country. If -a is enabled, a list of user agents will be
displayed by selecting the IP and hitting the return key.
.IP "Operating Systems"
Hit totals are based on unique visitors. This module will display hits and
percent. The expanded module shows all available versions of the parent node.
.IP "Browsers"
Hit totals are based on unique visitors. This module will display hits and
percent. The expanded module shows all available versions of the parent node.
.IP "Referrers URLs"
The URL where the request came from. Hit totals are based on total requests.
This module will display hits and percent.
.IP "Referring Sites"
This module will display only the host but not the whole URL. The URL where the
request came from. Hit totals are based on total requests. This module will
display hits and percent.
.IP "Keyphrases"
This module will report keyphrases used on Google search, Google cache, and
Google translate. Hit totals are based on total requests. This module will
display hits and percent.
.IP "Geo Location"
Determines where an IP address is geographically located. It outputs the
continent and country. If it's unable to determine the country, location will be
marked as unknown.
.IP "HTTP Status Codes"
The values of the numeric status code to HTTP requests. Hit totals are based on
total requests. This module will display hits and percent.

.SH CUSTOM LOG/DATE FORMAT
GoAccess can parse virtually any web log format.
.P
Predefined options include, Common Log Format (CLF), Combined Log Format
(XLF/ELF), including virtual host, Amazon CloudFront (Download Distribution) and
W3C format (IIS).
.P
GoAccess allows any custom format string as well.
.P
There are two ways to configure the log format.
The easiest is to run GoAccess with
.I -c
to prompt a configuration window. Otherwise, it can be configured under
~/.goaccessrc.
.IP "date_format"
The
.I date_format
variable followed by a space, specifies the log format date containing any
combination of regular characters and special format specifiers. They all begin
with a percentage (%) sign. See http://linux.die.net/man/3/strftime
.IP "log_format"
The
.I log_format
variable followed by a space, specifies the log format string.
.IP %d
date field matching the
.I date_format
variable.
.IP %h
host (the client IP address, either IPv4 or IPv6)
.IP %r
The request line from the client. This requires specific delimiters around the
request (as single quotes, double quotes, or anything else) to be parsable. If
not, we have to use a combination of special format specifiers as %m %U %H.
.IP %m
The request method.
.IP %U
The URL path requested (including any query string).
.IP %H
The request protocol.
.IP %s
The status code that the server sends back to the client.
.IP %b
The size of the object returned to the client.
.IP %R
The "Referer" HTTP request header.
.IP %u
The user-agent HTTP request header.
.IP %D
The time taken to serve the request, in microseconds.
.IP %T
The time taken to serve the request, in seconds or milliseconds.
.I Note:
%D will take priority over %T if both are used.
.IP %^
Ignore this field.
.SH INTERACTIVE MENU

.SH EXAMPLES
The simplest and fastest usage would be:
.IP
# goaccess -f access.log
.P
That will generate an interactive text-only output.
.P
To generate full statistics we can run GoAccess as:
.IP
# goaccess -f access.log -a
.P
To generate an HTML report:
.IP
# goaccess -f access.log -a > report.html
.P
To generate a JSON file:
.IP
# goaccess -f access.log -a -d -o json > report.json
.P
To generate a CSV file:
.IP
# goaccess -f access.log -o csv > report.csv
.P
The
.I -a
flag indicates that we want to process an agent-list for every host parsed.
.P
The
.I -d
flag indicates that we want to enable the IP resolver on the HTML | JSON output.
(It will take longer time to output since it has to resolve all queries.)
.P
The
.I -c
flag will prompt the date and log format configuration window. Only when
curses is initialized.
.P
Now if we want to add more flexibility to GoAccess, we can do a series of  pipes.
For instance:
.P
If we would like to process all
.I access.log.*.gz
we can do:
.IP
#  zcat access.log.*.gz | goaccess
.P
OR
.IP
#  zcat -f access.log* | goaccess
.P
Another useful pipe would be filtering dates out of the web log
.P
The following will get all HTTP requests starting on 05/Dec/2010 until
the end of the file.
.IP
# sed -n '/05\\/Dec\\/2010/,$ p' access.log | goaccess -a
.P
If we want to parse only a certain time-frame from DATE a to DATE b, we can do:
.IP
sed -n '/5\\/Nov\\/2010/,/5\\/Dec\\/2010/ p' access.log | goaccess -a
.P
.I Note that this could take longer time to parse depending on the speed of sed.
.P
To exclude a list of virtual hosts you can do the following:
.IP
grep -v "`cat exclude_vhost_list_file`" vhost_access.log | goaccess
.P
.B Also,
it is worth pointing out that if we want to run GoAccess at lower priority, we
can run it as:
.IP
# nice -n 19 goaccess -f access.log -a
.P
and if you don't want to install it on your server, you can still run it
from your local machine:
.IP
# ssh root@server 'cat /var/log/apache2/access.log' | goaccess -a
.P
.SH NOTES
For now, each active window has a total of 300 items. Eventually this will be
customizable.
.P
Piping a log to GoAccess will disable the real-time functionality. This is due
to the portability issue on determining the actual size of STDIN. However, a
future release *might* include this feature.

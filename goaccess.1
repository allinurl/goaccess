.SH NAME
goaccess \- fast web log analyzer and interactive viewer.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.B goaccess [-f input-file][\-c][\-r][\-d][\-m][\-q][\-o][\-h][...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B goaccess
is a free (GPL) real-time web log analyzer and interactive viewer that runs in a
terminal in *nix systems. It provides fast and valuable HTTP statistics for
system administrators that require a visual server report on the fly. GoAccess
parses the specified web log file and outputs the data to the X terminal.
Features include:

.IP "General Statistics:"
This panel gives a summary of several metrics, some of them are: number of
valid and invalid requests, time taken to analyze the data set, unique
visitors, requested files, static files (CSS, ICO, JPG, etc) HTTP referrers,
404s, size of the parsed log file and bandwidth consumption.
.IP "Unique visitors"
This panel shows metrics such as hits, unique visitors and cumulative
bandwidth per date. HTTP requests containing the same IP, the same date, and
the same user agent are considered a unique visitor. By default, it includes web
crawlers/spiders.
.IP "Requested files"
This panel displays the most highly requested files on your web server. It
shows hits, unique visitors, and percentage, along with the cumulative
bandwidth, protocol, and the request method used.
.IP "Requested static files"
Lists the most frequently static files such as: JPG, CSS, SWF, JS, GIF, and PNG
file types, along with the same metrics as the last module. Additional static
files can be added to the configuration file.
.IP "404 or Not Found"
Listed like previous panels, containing the same metrics. This panel lists the
top recurrent HTTP 404s.
.IP "Hosts"
This panel has detailed information on the hosts themselves. It displays the
same metrics as previous panels, such as number of hits, visitors, cumulative
bandwidth. This is great to spot aggressive crawlers and identifying who's
eating your bandwidth.

Expanding the panel can display more information such as host's reverse DNS
lookup result, country of origin and city. If the
.I -a
argument is enabled, a list of user agents can be displayed by selecting the
desired IP address, and then pressing ENTER.
.IP "Operating Systems"
This panel will report which operating system the host used when it hit the
server. It attempts to provide the most specific version of each operating
system.
.IP "Browsers"
This panel will report which browser the host used when it hit the server. It
attempts to provide the most specific version of each browser.
.IP "Visit Times"
This panel will display an hourly report. This option displays 24 data points,
one for each hour of the day.
.IP "Virtual Hosts"
This panel will display all the different virtual hosts parsed from the access
log. This panel is displayed if
.I %v
is used within the log-format string.
.IP "Referrers URLs"
If the host in question accessed the site via another resource, or was
linked/diverted to you from another host, the URL they were referred from will
be provided in this panel. See `--ignore-panel` in your configuration file to
enable it.
.I disabled
by default.
.IP "Referring Sites"
This panel will display only the host part but not the whole URL. The URL where
the request came from.
.IP "Keyphrases"
It reports keyphrases used on Google search, Google cache, and Google translate
that have lead to your web server. At present, it only supports Google search
queries. See `--ignore-panel` in your configuration file to enable it.
.I disabled
by default.
.IP "Geo Location"
Determines where an IP address is geographically located. Statistics are broken
down by continent and country. It needs to be compiled with GeoLocation
support.
.IP "HTTP Status Codes"
The values of the numeric status code to HTTP requests.

.P
.I NOTE:
Optionally and if configured, all panels can display the average time taken to
serve the request.

.SH STORAGE
.P
There are three storage options that can be used with GoAccess. Choosing one
will depend on your environment and needs.
.TP
Default Hash Tables
In-memory storage provides better performance at the cost of limiting the
dataset size to the amount of available physical memory. By default GoAccess
uses in-memory hash tables. If your dataset can fit in memory, then this will
perform fine. It has very good memory usage and pretty good performance.
.TP
Tokyo Cabinet On-Disk B+ Tree
Use this storage method for large datasets where it is not possible to fit
everything in memory. The B+ tree database is slower than any of the hash
databases since data has to be committed to disk. However, using an SSD greatly
increases the performance. You may also use this storage method if you need
data persistence to quickly load statistics at a later date.
.TP
Tokyo Cabinet In-memory Hash Database
An alternative to the default hash tables. It uses generic typing and thus it's
performance in terms of memory and speed is average.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.P
Multiple options can be used to configure GoAccess. For a complete up-to-date
list of configure options, run
.I ./configure --help

Processing Logs Incrementally

GoAccess has the ability to process logs incrementally through the on-disk
B+Tree database. It works in the following way:

A data set must be persisted first with --keep-db-files, then the same data set
can be loaded with --load-from-disk. If new data is passed (piped or through a
log file), it will append it to the original data set. To preserve the data at
all times, --keep-db-files must be used. If --load-from-disk is used without
--keep-db-files, database files will be deleted upon closing the program.

.SH CUSTOM LOG/DATE FORMAT
GoAccess can parse virtually any web log format.
.P
Predefined options include, Common Log Format (CLF), Combined Log Format
(XLF/ELF), including virtual host, Amazon CloudFront (Download Distribution),
Google Cloud Storage and W3C format (IIS).
.P
GoAccess allows any custom format string as well.
.P
There are two ways to configure the log format.
The easiest is to run GoAccess with
.I -c
to prompt a configuration window. Otherwise, it can be configured under
~/.goaccessrc or the %sysconfdir%.
.IP "time-format"
The
.I time-format
variable followed by a space, specifies the log format time
containing any combination of regular characters and special format specifiers.
They all begin with a percentage (%) sign. See `man strftime`.
.I %T or %H:%M:%S.
.IP
.I Note:
If a timestamp is given in microseconds,
.I
%f
must be used as
.I
time-format
.IP "date-format"
The
.I date-format
variable followed by a space, specifies the log format date containing any
combination of regular characters and special format specifiers. They all begin
with a percentage (%) sign. See `man strftime`. e.g.,
.I %Y-%m-%d.
.IP
.I Note:
If a timestamp is given in microseconds,
.I
%f
must be used as
.I
date-format
.IP "log-format"
The
.I log-format
variable followed by a space or
.I \\\\t
, specifies the log format string.
.IP %x
A date and time field matching the
.I time-format
and
.I date-format
variables. This is used when a timestamp is given instead of the date and time
being in two separated variables.
.IP %t
time field matching the
.I time-format
variable.
.IP %d
date field matching the
.I date-format
variable.
.IP %v
The canonical Server Name of the server serving the request (Virtual Host).
.IP %h
host (the client IP address, either IPv4 or IPv6)
.IP %r
The request line from the client. This requires specific delimiters around the
request (as single quotes, double quotes, or anything else) to be parsable. If
not, we have to use a combination of special format specifiers as %m %U %H.
.IP %q
The query string.
.IP %m
The request method.
.IP %U
The URL path requested.

.I Note:
If the query string is in %U, there is no need to use
.I %q.
However, if the URL path, does not include any query string, you may use
.I %q
and the query string will be appended to the request.
.IP %H
The request protocol.
.IP %s
The status code that the server sends back to the client.
.IP %b
The size of the object returned to the client.
.IP %R
The "Referrer" HTTP request header.
.IP %u
The user-agent HTTP request header.
.IP %D
The time taken to serve the request, in microseconds as a decimal number.
.IP %T
The time taken to serve the request, in seconds with milliseconds resolution.
.IP %L
The time taken to serve the request, in milliseconds as a decimal number.
.IP
.I Note:
If multiple time served specifiers are used at the same time, the first option
specified in the format string will take priority over the other specifiers.
.IP %^
Ignore this field.
.IP %~
Move forward through the log string until a non-space (!isspace) char is found.
.P
GoAccess
.I requires
the following fields:
.IP
.I %h
a valid IPv4/6
.IP
.I %d
a valid date
.IP
.I %r
the request
.SH INTERACTIVE MENU

.SH EXAMPLES
The simplest and fastest usage would be:
.IP
# goaccess -f access.log
.P
That will generate an interactive text-only output.
.P
To generate an interactive text-only output and enable a list of user-agents by
host:
.IP
# goaccess -f access.log -a
.P
To generate an HTML report:
.IP
# goaccess -f access.log -a > report.html
.P
To generate a JSON file:
.IP
# goaccess -f access.log -a -d -o json > report.json
.P
To generate a CSV file:
.IP
# goaccess -f access.log -o csv > report.csv
.P
The
.I -a
flag indicates that we want to process an agent-list for every host parsed.
.P
The
.I -d
flag indicates that we want to enable the IP resolver on the HTML | JSON output.
(It will take longer time to output since it has to resolve all queries.)
.P
The
.I -c
flag will prompt the date and log format configuration window. Only when
curses is initialized.
.P
Filtering can be done through the use of pipes. For instance, using grep to
filter specific data and then pipe the output into GoAccess. This adds a great
amount of flexibility to what GoAccess can display. For example:
.P
If we would like to process all
.I access.log.*.gz
we can do:
.IP
#  zcat access.log.*.gz | goaccess
.P
OR
.IP
#  zcat -f access.log* | goaccess
.P
(On Mac OS X, use `gunzip -c` instead of `zcat`).
.P
Another useful pipe would be filtering dates out of the web log
.P
The following will get all HTTP requests starting on 05/Dec/2010 until
the end of the file.
.IP
# sed -n '/05\\/Dec\\/2010/,$ p' access.log | goaccess -a
.P
or using relative dates such as yesterdays or tomorrows day:
.IP
# sed -n '/'$(date '+%d\/%b\/%Y' -d '1 week ago')'/,$ p' access.log | goaccess -a
.P
If we want to parse only a certain time-frame from DATE a to DATE b, we can do:
.IP
# sed -n '/5\\/Nov\\/2010/,/5\\/Dec\\/2010/ p' access.log | goaccess -a
.P
.I Note:
this could take longer time to parse depending on the speed of sed.
.P
To parse specific pages, e.g., page views, html, htm, php, etc. within a request:
.IP
# awk '$7~/\.html|\.htm|\.php/' access.log | goaccess
.P
Note, $7 is the request field for the common and combined log format, (without
Virtual Host), if your log includes Virtual Host, then you probably want to use
$8 instead. It's best to check which field you are shooting for, e.g.:
.IP
# tail -10 access.log | awk '{print $8}'
.P
Or to parse a specific status code, e.g., 500 (Internal Server Error):
.IP
# awk '$9~/500/' access.log | goaccess
.P
To exclude a list of virtual hosts you can do the following:
.IP
# grep -v "`cat exclude_vhost_list_file`" vhost_access.log | goaccess
.P
.B Also,
it is worth pointing out that if we want to run GoAccess at lower priority, we
can run it as:
.IP
# nice -n 19 goaccess -f access.log -a
.P
and if you don't want to install it on your server, you can still run it
from your local machine:
.IP
# ssh root@server 'cat /var/log/apache2/access.log' | goaccess -a
.P
.SH NOTES
For now, each active window has a total of 366 items. Eventually this will be
customizable. These 366 items are all available by default in the CSV and JSON
exports, and as an expandable panel in the HTML report (upper-right corner).
.P
Piping a log to GoAccess will disable the real-time functionality. This is due
to the portability issue on determining the actual size of STDIN. However, a
future release *might* include this feature.
.P
A hit is a request (line in the access log), e.g., 10 requests = 10 hits. HTTP
requests with the same IP, date, and user agent are considered a unique visit.

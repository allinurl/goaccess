Changes to GoAccess 0.9 - Thursday, March 19, 2015

  - Added --geoip-database command line option for GeoIP Country/City IPv6.
  - Added "Windows 10 (v6.4)" to the real windows user agents.
  - Added ability to double decode an HTTP referer and agent.
  - Added ability to sort views through the command line on initial load.
  - Added additional data values to the backtrace report.
  - Added additional graph to represent the visitors metric on the HTML output.
  - Added AM_PROG_CC_C_O to configure.ac
  - Added "Android Lollipop" to the list of operating systems.
  - Added "average time served" metric to all panels.
  - Added "bandwidth" metric to all panels.
  - Added command line option to disable summary metrics on the CSV output.
  - Added numeric formatting to the HTML output to improve readability.
  - Added request method specifier to the default W3C log format.
  - Added the ability to ignore parsing and displaying given panel(s).
  - Added the ability to ignore referer sites from being counted. A good case
    scenario is to ignore own domains. i.e., owndomain.tld. This also allows
    ignoring hosts using wildcards. For instance, *.mydomain.tld or www.mydomain.*
    or www?.mydomain.tld
  - Added time/hour distribution module. e.g., 00-23.
  - Added "visitors" metrics to all panels.
  - Changed AC_PREREQ macro version so it builds on old versions of autoconf.
  - Changed GEOIP database load to GEOIP_MEMORY_CACHE for faster lookups.
  - Changed maximum number of choices to display per panel to 366 fron 300.
  - Ensure config file is read from home dir if unable to open it from
    %sysconfdir% path.
  - Fixed array overflows when exceeding MAX_* limits on command line options.
  - Fixed a SEGFAULT where sscanf could not handle special chars within the
    referer.
  - Fixed character encoding on geolocation output (ISO-8859 to UTF8).
  - Fixed issue on wild cards containing "?" at the end of the string.
  - Fixed issue where a "Nothing valid to process" error was triggered when the
    number of invalid hits was equal to the number of valid hits.
  - Fixed issue where outputting to a file left a zero-byte file in pwd.
  - Improved parsing of operating systems.
  - Refactored log parser so it allows with ease the addition of new modules.
    This also attempts to decouple the core functionality from the rendering
    functions. It also gives the flexibility to add children metrics to root
    metrics for any module. e.g., Request A was visited by IP1, IP2, IP3, etc.
  - Restyled HTML output.

Changes to GoAccess 0.8.5 - Sunday, September 14, 2014

  - Added --444-as-404 command line option to handle nginx non-standard status
    code 444 as 404.
  - Added --4xx-to-unique-count command line option to count client errors (4xx)
    to the unique visitors count.  Now by default it omits client errors (4xx)
    from being added to the unique visitors count as they are probably not welcomed
    visitors. 4xx errors are always counted in panels other than visitors, OS &
    browsers.
  - Added and updated operating systems, and browsers.
  - Added excluded IP hits count to the general statistics panel on all reports.
  - Added HTTP nonstandard code "444" to the status code list.
  - Fixed compile error due to missing include <sys/types.h> for type
    off_t (gcc 4.1).

  - Added parsing progress metrics - total requests / requests per second.
  - Added the ability to parse a GeoLiteCity.dat to get the city given an IPv4.
  - Changed the way the configuration file is parsed. This will parse all
    configuration options under ~/.goaccessrc or the specified config file and
    will feed getopt_long with the extracted key/value pairs. This also allows the
    ability to have comments on the config file which won't be overwritten.
  - Ensure autoconf determines the location of ncurses headers.
  - Fixed issue where geo_location_data was NULL.
  - Fixed issue where GoAccess did not run without a tty allocated to it.
  - Fixed potential memory leak on --log-file realpath().

  - Implemented an on-memory hash database using Tokyo Cabinet. This
    implementation allows GoAccess not to rely on GLib's hash table if one is
    needed.
  - Implemented large file support using an on-disk B+ Tree database. This
    implementation allows GoAccess not to hold everything in memory but instead
    it uses an on-disk B+ Tree database.
  - Trimmed leading and trailing whitespaces from keyphrases module.

Changes to GoAccess 0.7.1 - Monday, February 17, 2014

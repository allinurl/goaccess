    or www?.mydomain.tld

    ability to have comments on the config file which won't be overwritten.
  - Ensure autoconf determines the location of ncurses headers.
  - Fixed issue where geo_location_data was NULL.
  - Fixed issue where GoAccess did not run without a tty allocated to it.

    implementation allows GoAccess not to hold everything in memory but instead
    it uses an on-disk B+ Tree database.

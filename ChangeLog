  - Fixed issue on HTML report to avoid outputting scientific notation for all
    byte sizes.
  - Fixed integer overflow when calculating bar graph length on terminal
    output.
  - Fixed issue where global config file would override command line arguments.
  - Fixed issue where it wouldn't allow loading from disk without specifying a
    file when executed from the cron.
  - Fixed issue where parser couldn't read some X-Forwarded-For (XFF) formats.
    Note that this breaks compatibility with the original implementation of
    parsing XFF, but at the same time it gives much more flexibility on different
    formats.
  - Fixed issue where specifying fifo-in/out wouldn't allow HTML real-time
    output.
  - Fixed issue where the wrong number of parsed lines upon erroring out was
    displayed.

    formats such as %F or %T.
  - Fixed build issues on systems running GLIBC older than 2.9, such as RHEL <= 5.
  - Fixed issue where it wouldn't send the whole buffer to a socket causing the
    real-time-html WebSocket server to progressively consume a lot more memory.
  - Fixed memory leak when using getline and follow mode enabled.

  - Added --4xx-to-unique-count command line option to count client errors (4xx)
    to the unique visitors count.  Now by default it omits client errors (4xx)

    ability to have comments on the config file which won't be overwritten.
  - Ensure autoconf determines the location of ncurses headers.
  - Fixed issue where geo_location_data was NULL.
  - Fixed issue where GoAccess did not run without a tty allocated to it.
  - Fixed potential memory leak on --log-file realpath().

  - Implemented an on-memory hash database using Tokyo Cabinet. This
    implementation allows GoAccess not to rely on GLib's hash table if one is

  - Implemented large file support using an on-disk B+ Tree database. This
    implementation allows GoAccess not to hold everything in memory but instead
    it uses an on-disk B+ Tree database.
  - Trimmed leading and trailing whitespaces from keyphrases module.

Changes to GoAccess 0.7.1 - Monday, February 17, 2014

  - Changed tarball's filename.
  - Fixed a request size parsing issue. Due to malformed syntax on the HTTP
    protocol, bandwidth was reset to 0. Ex. "HEAD /" 400 20392
  - Fixed a segfault when goaccess was executed without any options but with an
    additional unknown argument.

Changes to GoAccess 0.3.2 - Thursday, September 09, 2010

  - Code cleanups
  - Fixed a potential segmentation fault when resizing main window
  - Fixed a segmentation fault on pop-up window search if haystack was null
  - Fixed invalid entries when parsing status codes

    32-bit systems

  - Changed position of data/graphs depending on # of hits

Changes to GoAccess 0.2 - Sunday, July 25, 2010

  - Added a keyphrases report coming from Google search engine. This includes,
    raw, cache, and translation queries.
  - Fixed a memory leak when invalid entries were parsed
  - Fixed a potential buffer overflow.

    file grows. Equivalent to "tail -f" on Unix systems
  - Implemented screen resize functionality
  - Simplified creation of the "unique visitors" hash-key.
  - Simplified the "process_unique_data" function
  - Various small speed increases & code cleanup

Changes to GoAccess 0.1.2 - Monday, July 12, 2010

  - Fixed a segmentation fault when parsing logs with unusual request type. Ex.
    "GET HTTP/1.1 HTTP/1.1"

Changes to GoAccess 0.1.1 - Saturday, July 10, 2010

  - Added an enhanced error handling
  - Added an extra macro on configure.ac to check against GHashTableIter.
    ./configure might not check for glib 2.16 that introduced "GHashTableIter".
  - Added Glibc LFS
  - Cleaned up code a little bit
  - Fixed a segmentation fault when displaying the help text on x86_64.
  - Fixed assignments in conditions. In case the assignment is actually intended
    put extra parenthesis around it. This will shut GCC (and others) up.
  - Fixed casts associated with "g_hash_table_iter_next".
  - Fixed comparison between signed and unsigned integer types.
  - Fixed function declarations.
  - Fixed includes.
  - Fixed two format strings. (If the error was ever triggered, it'd most
    likely lead to a segfault)

  - Initial release 0.1
